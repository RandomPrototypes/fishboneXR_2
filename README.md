### Unity project for fishboneXR

Unofficial mixed reality fishbone experience for Quest 2 (similar to the obstacle from the japanese TV show SASUKE / ninja warrior).  
For best immersion, put some boxes to create a height difference between the steps. Be careful to make it stable to avoid falling, I'm not responsible in case of injury.

### How to execute on the Quest.
Download the apk file and install it to the quest using [sidequest](https://sidequestvr.com/).
Be sure to have the camera passthrough activated in the settings of the quest.

### How to play
Once the game started, press the button "calibrate" on the menu (yellow desk), align the fishbones with your environment and pinch your index and thumb to validate, or press the button A of your right controller.  

To re-open the menu during the game, pinch the index and thumb fingers of both hands or press the button A of the controller.  
If you get hit by the fishbones, come back to the start (blue area).
